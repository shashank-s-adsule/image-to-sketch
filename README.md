# image-to-sketch
it's basic machine learning project which is used to convert any image into relative sketch type image.

it was build using ___python___ and for operations on images ___OpenCV___ Framework was used. for color quantization part ___K-Means clustering___ Machine learning algorithm was used

steps involed in this process:
1. read image [using OpenCV]
2. grayscale conversion
3. edge masking
4. color quantization [using K-Means]
5. noise reduction using Bilateral filter 
6. combining edge mask and reconstructed color image
7. write resultant image in output folder

## read image & grayscale convertion

## color quantization 

## noise reduction 

## applying mask on colored image
