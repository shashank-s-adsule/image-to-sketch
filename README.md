# image-to-sketch
it's basic machine learning project which is used to convert any image into relative sketch type image.

it was build using ___python___ and for operations on images ___OpenCV___ Framework was used. for color quantization part ___K-Means clustering___ Machine learning algorithm was used

steps involed in this process:
1. [read image [using OpenCV]](#read-image-&-grayscale-convertion)
2. [grayscale conversion](#read-image-&-grayscale-convertion)
3. [edge masking](#color-quantization)
4. [color quantization [using K Means]](#edge-masking)
5. [noise reduction using Bilateral filter](#noise-reduction)
6. [combining edge mask and reconstructed color image](#applying-mask-on-colored-image)
7. write resultant image in output folder
